The brand needed to increase brand awareness, so we built a content creation strategy that aligned with our goals to achieve more attention. By maximizing our total engagements, video views, and follower growth, our average effectiveness rate resulted in a major increase. BUILDING BRAND AWARENESS WITH AN ATTENTION-GETTING STRATEGYWe kept the brand's video content to 5-7 posts a month including UGC, influencer repurposed content, short-form video, and in-house branded videos. The creativity of our content was flexible, focusing on video content, elevated photography, and engaging graphics. We prioritized content that spoke to the brand message and lifestyle feel. We also engaged in strategic giveaways and creative copywriting throughout the year, growing and maintaining our Instagram following.
